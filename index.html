    <p>Welcome to <i>Collective Realms Magazine</i>, the world's smallest Fantasy and Science Fiction magazine!</p>
    <h3>Letter from the Editor</h3>
    <p>What started with one man creating a blog to feature paladin-related content in 2014, went on to become a thriving internet community known as the "We Are Adventurers Collective". Over the following few years, over a hundred people would go on to become official members of the community, with even more becoming members of "spin-off" blogs.</p>
    <p>Now, in 2018, three years later, myself and my co-editor-in-chief are setting upon the enormous task of creating a literary magazine based off of the Collective. We hope that you enjoy what we are creating here at <i>Collective Realms Magazine</i> and look forward to reading the fantastical stories submitted to us.</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking part in our adventure.</p>
