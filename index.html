    <p>Welcome 2019! It's a new year, so get out there and write! Whether you made a resolution or not, we can't wait to see what you produce in this new year. Also, remember that we love to read and share the stories of the Collective Iconics and all of the other characters that exist within our "Collectiverse", so everyone is encouraged to submit their work!</p>
