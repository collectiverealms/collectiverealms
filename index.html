    <p>Welcome to <i>Collective Realms Magazine</i>, the world's smallest Fantasy and Science Fiction magazine!</p>
    <h4>Latest Stories</h4>
    {% include latestpost.html %}
    <h3>Editor's Desk: September</h3>
    <p>Collective Realms has been up and running for two months now, and we've published four stories thus far, with three currently in at various stages of the editing process. If the submissions continue at this increasing pace, we will soon no longer be able to claim the title of "smallest fantasy and science-fiction magazine", so keep those stories coming! We love to read and share the stories of the Collective Iconics and all of the other characters that exist within our "Collectiverse".</p>
    <p>There isn't much else to update, so I'm going to keep this short. If you didn't know already, the second magazine published under our Lazy Adventurer Publishing, Prismatica, is running a week-long "Free Editing Week", where the editing staff (myself included) will edit any and all submissions sent in. If you have a piece of fiction you'd like to get a second pair of eyes on, send it their way!</p>
    <p>Thank you for reading Collective Realms Magazine.</p>
