  <p>The pyromaniacal alchemist Moxie and Madness of the Dhun’galil, both of the Circle of Nemeses, were recently spotted dancing together atop the planar dreadnought, “The Little Conqueror”. What does this mean for the world? Is this a sign of a villainous romance? Can love even truly blossom amongst the wicked?</p>
