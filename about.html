<div class="about">
  <p><i>Collective Realms Magazine</i> is a weekly fantasy and science-fiction magazine published by Lazy Adventurer Publishing. The magazine started in May of 2018 and is currently open for submissions.</p>
  <p><i>Collective Realms Magazine</i> has its origins in featuring short stories of the adventurers within the Collective universe, as seen in the blogs of the <a href="http://weareadventurers.tumblr.com/">We Are Adventurers</a> Tumblr community. The magazine now features short fiction and poetry by all authors, both emerging and established. In the magazine's stories and poems, readers can find fantasy and science-fiction of all sub-genres and cross-genres. We happily include magical realism, contemporary science-fiction, urban fantasy, and more.</p>
  
  <p>The magazine was started by Andrew Olvera and Matthew Gustavson, who act as the magazine's duel editors-in-chief. Our grassroots literary magazine was created as Lazy Adventurer Publishing's first foray into the lit mag world. You can read <i>Collective Realms Magazine</i> online in its entirety for free in text form on our website. Additionally, each piece published receives a dramatic reading by a member of our team. These readings can be found on Spotify, iTunes, GooglePlay, and YouTube.</p>
